                    <p class="text-white" >A novel method is proposed for realizing exact inverse filtering of acoustic impulse responses in a room. This method is based on the principle called the multiple-inputloutput inverse theorem (MINT). 
                    Because a room impulse response generally has nonminimum phases, it has been impossible to realize exact inverse filtering of room
                    acoustics using previously reported methods.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-white" >However, the exact inverse of room acoustics can be realized using the proposed method.
                    With this method, the inverse is constructed from multiple FIR filters (transversal filters) by adding some extra acoustic signal-transmission channels produced by multiple loudspeakers or microphones. 
                    The coefficients of these FIR filters can be computed by the well-known rules of matrix algebra. 
                    Inverse filtering in a sound field is investigated experimentally.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-white" >It is shown that the proposed method is greatly superior to previous methods that use only one acoustic signal-transmission channel. 
                    The results in this paper prove the possibility of sound reproduction and sound receiving without any distortion caused by reflected sounds in a room.</p>
